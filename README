dictlib
=======

Features:
 - schema definition
 - validating a dictionary against a schema
 - creating a dictionary by schema rules
 - mapping dictionaries to Python objects (adapter or mixin)
 - dot notation for nested dictionaries (adapter or mixin)

Plans:
 - dict comparison
 - dict merge by definable criteria
 - bidirectional dict (?)
 - documentation, examples for building a db wrapper with dictionaries as
   objects
 - sorted dictionaries: by key, by value, by lambda result
 - standard converters: JSON Schema, schema classes by other frameworks, e.g. 
   Django (?)
 - enum option for fields to restrict value to a given set
