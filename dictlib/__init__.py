"""
`dictlib` is a library for easy complex handling of dictionaries in Python.

It currently has the following features:
 - schema definition
 - validating a dictionary against a schema
 - creating a dictionary by schema rules
 - mapping dictionaries to Python objects (adapter or mixin)
 - dot notation for nested dictionaries (adapter or mixin)

`dictlib` has many possible uses, including the painless development of 
interfaces to JSON APIs. See `couchlib` for an example.
